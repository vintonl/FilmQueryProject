## Film Query Application Project

### Week 7 Weekend Project at Skill Distillery

### Overview:

This program is designed to a be command-line application that retrieves and displays film data from a database using Java Database Connectivity.

### How to run:

First, the user enters their menu selection. The user can choose to:
1. Lookup a film by its ID.
2. Lookup a film by a search keyword.
3. Exit the application.

The Film Query Application will then start the search process of the database and return the result to the command-line. The user will then be prompted again with the options above to either continue searching or exit the application.

### Technologies used:

Java EE, Maven, SQL, MySQL, Apache, Eclipse, Atom, Git, and Github.

### Topics implemented:

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) including Nested Retrieval and Prepared Statement.

Relational Databases: SQL Databases and Java Database Connectivity.

Java Libraries: SQL, ArrayList, List, and handling exceptions.

Object-Oriented Programming in Java: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.

Java Fundamentals of Programming: Iteration, recursion, advanced for loops, try/catch and finally statements, and a switch statement.

Test Driven Development using JUNIT Juniper.

### Lessons learned:

This project helped me better grasp the capabilities of Object-Oriented Programming by allowing me to better learn how to:
1. Build classes in an Object-Oriented manner.
2. Use a database to populate the data of the program.
3. Write SQL queries including join, join conditions, and join tables.
4. Use JUNIT testing.
